# SimpleGit

## Git for idiots, for if cloud computing P&!Â£%S you off

I hate typing repetitive stuff so this was created, all commands have shortened versions for speed. This is designed to be beginner friendly, so if youve never used VCS before this is  good starting point. Also, this doesnt use cloud intergration, I wanted this to be as simple as possible. Enjoy!


## Installation

1. Clone the Repo, or download the zip and place wherever youd like
2. Place the folder path of the repo into your PATH variable
3. Its best to restart your env at this point
4. You should be good to go
